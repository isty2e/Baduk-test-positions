# Baduk-test-positions
A set of board positions for the game of go (baduk/weiqi) where engines struggle to evaluate correctly. The last moves in the sgf files are either blind spots, or moves which can cause a great deal of confusion to the search, but not necessarily the best move.

Create an issue to submit more blind spots, then I will be gladly expanding this collection.
